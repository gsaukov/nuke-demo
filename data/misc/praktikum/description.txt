1. Client Server relations.
2. HTML and JSON documents data formats.
3. JavaScript as programming languge that is executed in browser.
4. OL library that embeds all necessary functions to draws a map and the layer.
5. Array, of numbers and most common actions for cycle and access by index.
6. If clause and numbers comparisson.
7. General understanding of the application and its bussines logic:

Load Client:
  First step is load the resources: HTML document, Openlayers layers library and JSON file with data.
  The JavaScript program starts by reading data from a JSON file, which is a way to store data in text format.

Understand the Map Area:
  It looks at the corners of a big rectangle (population map) to understand where the map starts and ends.
  It checks how wide and tall this rectangle is in terms of tiny squares.
  Setup the Center: It finds the middle point of the map, so it knows where to focus when showing the map.

Loop Through the Data:
  The program looks at a array of numbers that represent human density on the map and wants to represent this array as blocks or pixels.
  For each number in the array, it checks a number to see if there's at least one person living theree.
  If there are people (the number is bigger than 0), it remembers this block and calculates its position on the map.

Create the Map:
  With help of openlayers library creates a maps and loads
  It sets the view to the middle of the map and zooms in so you can see it clearly.

Draw Layer Blocks:
  For each remembered block, it draws a small square on the map using block's position.
  The color or style of each block change based on how many people live there (this is decided by a function called getStyle).
